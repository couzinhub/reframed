      <h2>Technical Issues</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>The image looks stretched or cropped incorrectly on my TV. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Make sure your TV's picture settings are set to "Fit to Screen" or similar in art mode. If the issue persists, the artwork might not match your specific Frame TV model's aspect ratio. Feel free to contact me for a custom adjustment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why are some artworks only available in landscape orientation?</h3>
        <p>Most Frame TVs are designed for landscape orientation. However, I do offer a selection of vertical artworks for Frame TVs that can be mounted in portrait mode. Check the "Vertical artworks" section for these options.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>The download link isn't working. What should I do?</h3>
