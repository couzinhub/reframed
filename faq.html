      <h2>General Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is Reframed?</h3>
        <p>Reframed is a free collection of classic paintings and photography that have been digitally modified to perfectly fit Samsung Frame TVs. Each artwork is carefully cropped and optimized to display beautifully on your Frame TV in art mode.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this service really free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! All artworks in the collection are completely free to download and use. If you find the service valuable, you can support the project with a tip via Ko-fi, but it's entirely optional.</p>

          <span>Thank me with a tip</span>
        </a></p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a Samsung Frame TV?</h3>
        <p>While the artworks are optimized for Samsung Frame TVs, you can use them on any display. The images are high-quality and work great as digital art on monitors, tablets, or other smart displays.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Who are you and why are you doing this?</h3>
      <p>I'm just a Canadian dude with a Frame TV who’s always hunting for new art to put on it. As a graphic designer, I care about how things are framed, but mostly, I just enjoy finding and sharing great images that look good on the TV. I often have some extra time, so I figured I’d make it easy for other Frame TV owners to do the same.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do you do it?</h3>
      <p>I edit every image by hand in Photoshop, no AI involved (yuck!). Each artwork is different, so I use a variety of techniques, but the goal is always the same: preserve as much of the original as possible. I want the final result to feel like it was made in this format from the start. Ideally, even someone who knows the artwork well shouldn’t be able to tell it was altered at all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why don't you do more modern paintings?</h3>
      <p>Art becomes public domain only 80 years after the death of the artist, so it is often difficult to find high-resolution version of art pieces from recent artists. My main source of art is Wikimedia Commons.</p>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Using the Artworks</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I download an artwork?</h3>
        <p>Simply click on any artwork in the gallery. This will download the image right away to your device. There is no limit to how many you can download.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What resolution are the images?</h3>
        <p>All images are 3840 by 2160 for landscapes, and 2160 by 3840 for portraits.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I add artwork to my Samsung Frame TV?</h3>
        <p>Transfer the downloaded images to a USB drive, plug it into your Frame TV, and use the TV's art mode menu to select and display your chosen artwork. Alternatively, you can use the SmartThings app to upload images directly from your phone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use these for commercial purposes?</h3>
        <p>The artworks are provided for personal use only. Most images are based on public domain paintings, but please verify the licensing for your specific use case if you plan to use them commercially.</p>

        <h3>How much does a custom reframe cost?</h3>

      <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why are some artworks only available in landscape orientation?</h3>
        <p>Most Frame TVs are designed for landscape orientation. However, I do offer a selection of vertical artworks for Frame TVs that can be mounted in portrait mode. Check the "Vertical artworks" section for these options.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>The download link isn't working. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache. If the problem persists, please contact me with details about which artwork you're trying to access, and I'll investigate the issue.</p>
